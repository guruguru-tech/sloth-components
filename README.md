# Sloth Components

Sloth Components is a web components library designed for the laziest developers out there, and it's completely framework-agnostic thanks to Lit Elements technology. The purpose of this library is to provide certain elements that encapsulate these components for various frameworks, but it's entirely optional. The goal is to avoid dependency on other libraries and avoid building repetitive components out of sheer laziness to do them over and over again.
